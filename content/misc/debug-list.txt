- Pre-submit:
	- Did you make a typo when copying a template?
	- Test more cases if unsure.
		- Write a naive solution and check small cases.
	- Submit the correct file.
- General Debugging:
	- Read the whole problem again.
	- Have a teammate read the problem.
	- Have a teammate read your code.
		- Explain you solution to them (or a rubber duck).
	- Print the code and its output / debug output.
	- Go to the toilet.
- Wrong Answer:
	- Any possible overflows?
		- > `__int128` ?
		- Try `-ftrapv` or `#pragma GCC optimize("trapv")`
	- Floating point errors?
		- > `long double` ?
		- turn off math optimizations
		- check for `==`, `>=`, `acos(1.000000001)`, etc.
	- Did you forget to sort or unique?
	- Generate large and worst "corner" cases.
	- Check your `m` / `n`, `i` / `j` and `x` / `y`.
	- Are everything initialized or reset properly?
	- Are you sure about the STL thing you are using?
		- Read cppreference (should be available).
	- Print everything and run it on pen and paper.
- Time Limit Exceeded:
	- Calculate your time complexity again.
	- Does the program actually end?
		- Check for `while(q.size())` etc.
	- Test the largest cases locally.
	- Did you do unnecessary stuff?
		- e.g. pass vectors by value
		- e.g. `memset` for every test case
	- Is your constant factor reasonable?
- Runtime Error:
	- Check memory usage.
		- Forget to clear or destroy stuff?
		- > `vector::shrink_to_fit()`
	- Stack overflow?
	- Bad pointer / array access?
		- Try `-fsanitize=address`
	- Division by zero? NaN's?
